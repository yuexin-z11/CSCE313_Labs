The reverse tunneling creates a path from the laptop to VM. 
The laptop sets up a SSH connection to the VM. -R will create a lisnter on the VM's port 80.
From there, all the incoming requests to the VM's port 80 are forwarded through the SSH connection
to the laptop's port 8080.
The server running on the laptop will then respond to the requests and send the repsponses back
to the VM and then to the client. 

3.
It is because of the reverse tunnel that was established. The ssh client instructs the VM to listen 
for connections on port 80. When a request comes to port 80 on the VM, will then be forwarded to 
port 8080 on the laptop through the SSH tunnel.
