Since there are two files that are the same name from the two different directory, there is only one name showing. 
UnionFS typically shows the file from the higher precedence filesystem, in this case is dir1.
Therefore conflict.txt from dir1 is displayed in the union. 

3. 
conflict.txt file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt newfile.txt
After the union mounted and the new file is added to dir1. It showed up immediately in the union directory.
UnionFS dynamically manages the view based on the undelying directories.
